import CrawlSource from '!!raw-loader!./crawl_relative_links.js';

If a website uses relative links, [`CheerioCrawler`](/docs/api/cheerio-crawler) and `Apify.enqueueLinks()` may
have trouble following them. This is why it is important to set the `baseUrl` property within `Apify.enqueueLinks()` to
`request.loadedUrl`:

<CodeBlock className="language-js">
	{CrawlSource}
</CodeBlock>
